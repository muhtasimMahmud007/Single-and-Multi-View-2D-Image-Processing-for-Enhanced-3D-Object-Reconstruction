# Single-and-Multi-View-2D-Image-Processing-for-Enhanced-3D-Object-Reconstruction
This paper presents an efficient approach for 3D object reconstruction using Single and
multi- view 2D image processing. In real-world scenarios, it also focuses on practical
applications. Our approach is about the advanced image processing techniques as well
as deep learning models which convert multiple 2D views of an object into a detailed 3D
model. Our method is a novel application of convolutional neural networks that merge
features from each view for ensuring consistent geometry and texture in the final model.
Additionally, we introduce a robust merging module based on CNN. It improves the
modelâ€™s fidelity by focusing on areas with significant detail variation across different views.
Our tests on lots of challenging datasets show that our method enhances computational
efficiency as well as it has significant potential for practical applications in areas such as
virtual reality, augmented reality, and automated quality control in manufacturing. This
research marks a significant step forward in digital imaging and computer vision, offering
new possibilities for industry and technology advancements.
